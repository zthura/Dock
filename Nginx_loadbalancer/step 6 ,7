Step 6: Build & Run
docker-compose up --build
Open browser: http://localhost:8080

Refresh multiple times → you will see App 1 and App 2 responses alternating.

✅ Step 7: Verify
Check running containers:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
Test load balancing:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080
You should see responses from both apps in a round-robin manner.
