This Dockerfile creates a lightweight web server using Nginx to serve static files. Here's a simple breakdown of each line:

üê≥ Line-by-Line Explanation
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
- Base image: Uses the official Nginx image built on Alpine Linux (a tiny, fast Linux distro).
- Why Alpine? It's minimal, which makes the final image smaller and faster.
COPY site/ /usr/share/nginx/html
- Copies your website files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) from the local site/ folder into Nginx‚Äôs default web directory.
- This is where Nginx looks for files to serve.
# Default nginx.conf from image is fine for this simple project
- Comment: No custom configuration is needed. The default Nginx settings are enough to serve static files.
EXPOSE 80
- Opens port 80 on the container so it can receive HTTP traffic.
- This is the standard web port used by browsers.

üöÄ What This Dockerfile Does
It builds a container that:
- Runs Nginx on Alpine Linux
- Serves static content from the site/ folder
- Listens for web traffic on port 80
You can run it with:
docker build -t my-nginx-site .
docker run -p 8080:80 my-nginx-site


Then visit http://localhost:8080 to see your site!
Let me know if you want to add custom config, enable HTTPS, or deploy it to the cloud.
